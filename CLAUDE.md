# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`rules_vulkan` is a set of Bazel rules for integrating the Vulkan SDK into builds. It automates downloading,
installing, and using Vulkan SDKs across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. The rules support compiling GLSL,
HLSL, and Slang shaders, plus spirv-cross transpilation.

## Common Commands

### Build and Test
- `bazelisk test //tests/...` - Run unit tests
- `bazelisk run :app --verbose_failures` - Run the e2e smoke test (from e2e/smoke directory)
- `bazelisk build //...` - Build all targets

### Linting and Formatting
- `bazelisk run :lint` - Check Bazel file formatting (lint mode)
- `bazelisk run :fmt` - Format Bazel files with buildifier

### Documentation
- `bazelisk run //docs:update` - Update generated documentation
- `bazelisk run //docs:update_test` - Verify documentation is up to date

### SDK Version Updates
- `python tools/update_versions.py` - Fetch latest Vulkan SDK versions and update versions.bzl (outputs properly formatted code)
- Check for changes in versions.bzl - if there are changes, create a PR with the updates
- If no changes, report "no new versions available" and specify the latest currently available version

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Vulkan SDK Management**: The `download_sdk` rule and `vulkan_sdk` module extension handle automatic SDK download
and installation. Available SDK versions are maintained in `vulkan/private/versions.bzl` (updated via
`tools/update_versions.py`). The `versions.bzl` file contains a list of known Vulkan SDK versions available on the
LunarG website. Use `tools/update_versions.py` to fetch available versions and rebuild `versions.bzl`.

**Shader Compilation Rules**: 
- `glsl_shader` - Compiles GLSL shaders using glslc
- `hlsl_shader` - Compiles HLSL shaders using DirectXShaderCompiler (dxc)
- `slang_shader` - Compiles Slang shaders using slangc
- `spirv_cross` - Transpiles SPIR-V to other shader languages

**Toolchain System**: Uses Bazel toolchains to provide compiler binaries (dxc, glslc, slangc, spirv-cross) from the
downloaded SDK.

**Providers and Info**: `ShaderInfo` and `ShaderGroupInfo` providers carry metadata about compiled shaders for
building shader databases.

### File Structure

- `vulkan/defs.bzl` - Main public API exports
- `vulkan/private/` - Implementation details for each shader compiler
- `vulkan/extensions.bzl` - Module extension for SDK management
- `vulkan/toolchains.bzl` - Toolchain definitions
- `e2e/smoke/` - Integration test showcasing all features

## Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Write clean and idiomatic Starlark code following Bazel best practices
- All public APIs must include comprehensive documentation
- Always proofread and reword documentation or comments as needed for clarity and correctness
- Check for spelling errors and typos in code reviews
- Avoid adding comments that describe removed code or reference past implementation details

### Commit Messages and PRs
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the change and its purpose
- PR titles are used to generate changelog, so they must be formatted accordingly and clearly describe the feature or fix
- **IMPORTANT**: Before making a commit, always run formatter and linter: `bazelisk run :fmt` and `bazelisk run :lint`
- Before opening a PR, ensure documentation is up to date: `bazelisk run //docs:update`
- For PR descriptions, keep it simple with just a few sentences that describe the change - don't add structured sections like "Summary", "Test plan", etc.
- Don't add "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)" to commit messages.
- Don't add "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" to commit messages.

### Pre-Push Checklist
Before pushing code to the repository, ensure the following steps are completed:
1. Update documentation: `bazelisk run //docs:update`
2. Run buildifier linter and formatter: `bazelisk run :lint` and `bazelisk run :fmt`
3. Execute e2e tests to verify functionality

## Documentation

Generated API documentation is available in `docs/index.md` with detailed descriptions of all rules, attributes,
and providers.

## Testing

The project has both unit tests (`tests/`) and integration tests (`e2e/smoke/`). The CI runs tests across
Windows, Linux, and macOS with multiple Bazel versions.
